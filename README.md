ðŸš€ Task 1 Completed: Building a Stunning Landing Page! ðŸš€

Excited to share that I've successfully completed Task 1 of my web development journeyâ€”a fully functional landing page! ðŸ’»

This project was a great way to apply foundational HTML and CSS skills. I got hands-on experience with: âœ… Structuring content using columns and sections 
âœ… Designing headers, footers, and various page elements âœ… Mastering the alignment, padding, and color palette to create a visually appealing layout 

CSS was a game-changer in ensuring a seamless, non-overlapping design. This project pushed my creativity and attention to detail, and I'm excited to take on more challenges ahead! ðŸ’¡âœ¨
